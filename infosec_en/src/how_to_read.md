This book is for everyone. This means, regardless if you are a seasoned professional looking for perspective or a beginner looking to safeguard your personal information this is for you.

Each module has several parts. The first one is a scenario from the non-professional world. A story that simply highlights and helps an individual understand the reasons behind this. 
If you are a beginner, or just curious, this section is for you. The authors still recommend seasoned professionals to read this part as well, not to learn but to perhaps see it from a perspective of a non-professional. 

The experienced person within the field can, and should be able to jump into any of the modules and read.
The modules then continue into actual actions to do. And the reasons why. Each part of the module has been split up into several parts:
> *Beginner*
>
> This is the bare minimum that needs to be done. While not a full-fledged information security program, implementing all of the beginner steps gets you well on the way to evolve, understand and secure your information!

> *Intermediate* 
>
> This is for an organization that have already started working with information security albeit having few resources to do so. Perhaps grabbing one of the modules to add to their workflow. Or maybe taking the entire thing and modifying it to fit your needs. 

> *Expert* 
>
> This is for an organization investing heavily into information security. Having tons of resources as their disposal, being able to run all the modules simulataneously and improving continiously. Perhaps even helping to contribute to this book!

Each of these

The most important thing though, is that information security is an iterative process. It is a never-ending job. It needs to evolve contantly, not only within your organisation, but also in tandem with the threat landscape.
There are new regulations and compliances every year examples include, but are not limited to GDPR(*General Data Protection Regulation*), NIS-directive(*Network and Information Security directive) and FISMA(*The Federal Information Security Management Act*). 

[//]: <> (Working titles The best way to read this guide is to get a general understanding of 
information security and the short introduction.

If you have a good understanding what information security is all about, you
could jump directly to the moduls section.

> Important to know is you will need the foundation of assessing your 
> information, therfor the first moduls is mandatory for the other moduls to 
> work. As long as you have the first module in place you are on a great start

If there is one thing that you should take from this guide; that this is an
interative process, and that just by starting this process you have taken the 
first step to improve not only your security but your compliance as well.
It will be a difficult start and a steep learning curve, but the rewards are
that you will be safe and compliant with not only the laws like GDPR and 
EU directive like NIS, but also have a much better understanding and security
in case of a breach, you will be prepared and might even stop the intruder
before it can do any harm. )
 

*The modules then go into more organizational work, something you as a professional, or someone new within the field can apply to your organization. The modules can be freely interchangeable, however, the authors recommend that they are done in order.*
