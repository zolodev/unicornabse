The best way to read this guide is to get a general understanding of 
information security and the short introduction.

If you have a good understanding what information security is all about, you
could jump directly to the moduls section.

> Important to know is you will need the foundation of assessing your

If there is one thing that you should take from this guide; that this is an
interative process, and that just by starting this process you have taken the 
first step to improve not only your security but your compliance as well.
It will be a difficult start and a steep learning curve, but the rewards are
that you will be safe and compliant with not only the laws like GDPR and 
EU directive like NIS, but also have a much better understanding and security
in case of a breach, you will be prepared and might even stop the intruder
before it can do any harm.
