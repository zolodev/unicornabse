# Quickstart

A great example where to start is to take a look at password policies.
As of today year 2022, we need at least 14 characters to make a strong password.

So if you need a quickfix, start with these two:
    
1. Remove password retention polices (not forcing users to change passwords)
2. All users should have a password with at least 14 characters of lenght.

The rest of the information in this guide will be added over time.
This guide is a work in progress and will be a subject to change.
