One thing that is most important when gathering information, is to make sure
that the right people working with the information is gathered to sit down and
to talk about the information. That the people working with the data and the 
information is actually part of the assesment. This has been proven several
times that this will have the best impact and also is the quickest to get the
correct information when the assesment of the data and information begins.

Another important thing is to know the threat against the organisation, however
this new model of being modulare, this is an optional part in our opinion.

## Important note
> We recommend that all modules should always be implemented, but if this is
> the first iteration, this step could potentially be skipped. But it is important
> to know then that the risk of classify the information higher will cost more
> in the end. The reason a threat model is important is to have a better understanding
> if the threat is devastating to the holder of the asset.
> The threat modell helps to set the correct level of protection, that also 
> will not only save the cost of the defense, but also to set the correct level
> of defense.

## Example for a workshop
1. Describe a general threat model
2. Create a threat model of the organisation
3. Create a risk assessment with risk scenarios
