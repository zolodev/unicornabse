# Introduction

This guide started with a passion for both information security and IT-security.
Due to the fact where there is a cyber war going on in the world as of the writting 
of this guide.

We want to share with the world the information in a condenced way and create 
a framework where everyone can contribute to this cause. To make the world a
more secure and spread the awareness to the people.

It is also important for us that everything we create here is free for everyone
to make sure that as many as possible team up against the threats. Because as
a defender, always fight from bottom.

Information security should always be free and available for everyone.
