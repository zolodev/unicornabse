In 2022, the cyberthreat landscape had evolved into a hard to navigate and dangerous place. A lot of organizations where already behind the curve, and the bad actors had a huge advantage.
There was a severe lack of free resources within the information security field, and the ones that where out there are hard for someone new within the field to navigate.
Realizing this nimi and zolo, who had a passion for information security noted that something had to be done. The people with the knowledge and know-how needs to help the ones without. 
This book or guide if you will is meant for everyone, seasoned professionals looking for new perspectives, new organizations or companies without a dedicated information security officer or normal people in their everyday lives. 

The authors aims to condense the current best practices and standards out there, into a more easily applied format. 
Think of this book as an ISMS(*Information Security Management System*) in a box.

It is of importance to the authors that information is free for anyone who wants it. Being on the defense in the information security sector means you are already fighting an uphill battle.

Information security should **always** be free and available to everyone.

Once all modules are implemented, you've come a long way in securing your organization.
