# Chapter 1 - The value of an asset

You take a picture of your child.
Instantly you look at the picture and determine if it is a good picture, is this something you want to save, or do you want to delete it? 
Assuming you want to save this picture. You have now created an asset, something that is of value to you.  Something that you want to protect, and keep.
You now have to determine the value of your asset. 
How would one determine the value of a picture. By looking at it of course, this you already did. But there are other variables at play. 
A picture is a moment frozen in time, something that will never happen again. The motive of the picture is your child, someone who will age - and at some point not look the same again. The occasion might be a happy or a sad one, something that you want to share with the world, or something you want to keep with only your closest friends and relatives. 
These are questions you automatically answer when looking at the picture, and the same thing applies to any asset you have. Any particular piece of information you have. 

In addition to this, when determining the value of an asset, you look at it from several factors, can it provide you with gain of any kind, monetary, reputation wise or sentimental. The reason does not matter, as long as you know it yourself. 

Based on the value of the picture, and the impact it has on you as an individual if it is seen by the wrong person, if the picture is corrupted and can no longer be viewed or if the picture is no longer available to you when you want to look at it you now have to make a few decisions. 

We will look at this from an information security standpoint, what happens if either of confidentiality, integrity and availability is broken?

**Confidentiality**, meaning if the picture is seen by someone who is not supposed or allowed to see it.
**Integrity**, meaning if the picture is distorted, or changed in any way from the original.
**Availability**, meaning if this picture is not available to you when you want to look at it, or when you want to see it, if it is lost forever?

What is the impact to you personally?
What is the impact to your child? 
Can this be harmful? 
*Can information in the picture be used to harm you, your family or another person or organisation?*
Is there an impact on your daily life?
*Maybe want to use this picture to create holiday cards, or make a photo album.*
*Maybe you have this picture on your desk, to remind you of what is valuable in life?*
Is there a financial impact?
Is there an impact on your reputation? 
*Can this picture be used to defame you and your family, or used as blackmail?*

Your answer to these questions, any many more means you have now classified your picture, or the asset. It has a value, and has been categorized.
