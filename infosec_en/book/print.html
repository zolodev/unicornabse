<p>This guide started with a passion for both information security and IT-security.
Due to the fact where there is a cyber war going on in the world as of the writting 
of this guide.</p>
<p>We want to share with the world the information in a condenced way and create 
a framework where everyone can contribute to this cause. To make the world a
more secure and spread the awareness to the people.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="quickstart"><a class="header" href="#quickstart">Quickstart</a></h1>
<p>A great example where to start is to take a look at password policies.
As of today year 2022, we need at least 14 characters to make a strong password.</p>
<p>So if you need a quickfix, start with these two:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove password retention polices (not forcing users to change passwords)</li>
<li>All users should have a password with at least 14 characters of lenght.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rest of the information in this guide will be added over time.
This guide is a work in progress and will be a subject to change.</p>

<p>You take a picture of your child.
Instantly you look at the picture and determine if it is a good picture, is this something you want to save, or do you want to delete it? 
Assuming you want to save this picture. You have now created an asset, something that is of value to you.  Something that you want to protect, and keep.
You now have to determine the value of your asset. 
How would one determine the value of a picture. By looking at it of course, this you already did. But there are other variables at play. 
A picture is a moment frozen in time, something that will never happen again. The motive of the picture is your child, someone who will age - and at some point not look the same again. The occasion might be a happy or a sad one, something that you want to share with the world, or something you want to keep with only your closest friends and relatives. 
These are questions you automatically answer when looking at the picture, and the same thing applies to any asset you have. Any particular piece of information you have. </p>
<p>In addition to this, when determining the value of an asset, you look at it from several factors, can it provide you with gain of any kind, monetary, reputation wise or sentimental. The reason does not matter, as long as you know it yourself. </p>
<p>Based on the value of the picture, and the impact it has on you as an individual if it is seen by the wrong person, if the picture is corrupted and can no longer be viewed or if the picture is no longer available to you when you want to look at it you now have to make a few decisions. </p>
<p>We will look at this from an information security standpoint, what happens if either of confidentiality, integrity and availability is broken?</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>, meaning if the picture is seen by someone who is not supposed or allowed to see it.
<strong>Integrity</strong>, meaning if the picture is distorted, or changed in any way from the original.
<strong>Availability</strong>, meaning if this picture is not available to you when you want to look at it, or when you want to see it, if it is lost forever?</p>
<p>What is the impact to you personally?
What is the impact to your child? 
Can this be harmful? 
<em>Can information in the picture be used to harm you, your family or another person or organisation?</em>
Is there an impact on your daily life?
<em>Maybe want to use this picture to create holiday cards, or make a photo album.</em>
<em>Maybe you have this picture on your desk, to remind you of what is valuable in life?</em>
Is there a financial impact?
Is there an impact on your reputation? 
<em>Can this picture be used to defame you and your family, or used as blackmail?</em></p>
<p>Your answer to these questions, any many more means you have now classified your picture, or the asset. It has a value, and has been categorized.</p>

    Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
    To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme.

<p>Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.</p>
<pre><code>Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.

To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
