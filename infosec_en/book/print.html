<p>Using Creative Commons Public Licenses</p>
<p>Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.</p>
<pre><code>Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.

<p>Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License</p>
<p>By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License (&quot;Public License&quot;). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Section 1 – Definitions.</p>
<pre><code>Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.
Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
BY-NC-SA Compatible License means a license listed at creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.
Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are Attribution, NonCommercial, and ShareAlike.
Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.
NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the exchange.
Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
</code></pre>
<p>Section 2 – Scope.</p>
<pre><code>License grant.
    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
        reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and
        produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.
    Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
    Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
    Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
    Downstream recipients.
        Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
        Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.
        No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
    No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
Other rights.
    Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
    Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
    To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial purposes.
</code></pre>
<p>Section 3 – License Conditions.</p>
<p>Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.</p>
<pre><code>Attribution.
    If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
        retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:
            identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
            a copyright notice;
            a notice that refers to this Public License;
            a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
            a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;
        indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
        indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
    You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
    If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
ShareAlike.

In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
    The Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.
    You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.
    You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
</code></pre>
<p>Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.</p>
<p>Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:</p>
<pre><code>for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;
if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
</code></pre>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.</p>
<p>Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.</p>
<pre><code>Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.

The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
</code></pre>
<p>Section 6 – Term and Termination.</p>
<pre><code>This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
    automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
    upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
</code></pre>

<p>In 2022, the cyberthreat landscape had evolved into a hard to navigate and dangerous place. A lot of organizations where already behind the curve, and the bad actors had a huge advantage.
There was a severe lack of free resources within the information security field, and the ones that where out there are hard for someone new within the field to navigate.
Realizing this nimi and zolo, who had a passion for information security noted that something had to be done. The people with the knowledge and know-how needs to help the ones without. 
This book or guide if you will is meant for everyone, seasoned professionals looking for new perspectives, new organizations or companies without a dedicated information security officer or normal people in their everyday lives. </p>
<p>The authors aims to condense the current best practices and standards out there, into a more easily applied format. 
Think of this book as an ISMS(<em>Information Security Management System</em>) in a box.</p>
<p>It is of importance to the authors that information is free for anyone who wants it. Being on the defense in the information security sector means you are already fighting an uphill battle.</p>
<p>Information security should <strong>always</strong> be free and available to everyone.</p>
<p>Once all modules are implemented, you've come a long way in securing your organization.</p>

<p>A great example where to start is to take a look at password policies.
As of today year 2022, we need at least 14 characters to make a strong password.</p>
<p>So if you need a quickfix, start with the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove password retention polices (do not force users to change passwords).</li>
<li>All passwords should be a minimum of 14 characters.</li>
<li>Always use multifactor authentication (MFA), we recommend <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">Yubikeys</a> or similar.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rest of the information in this guide will be added over time.
This guide is a work in progress and will be a subject to change.</p>

<p>This book is for everyone. This means, regardless if you are a seasoned professional looking for perspective or a beginner looking to safeguard your personal information this is for you.</p>
<p>Each module has several parts. The first one is a scenario from the non-professional world. A story that simply highlights and helps an individual understand the reasons behind this. 
If you are a beginner, or just curious, this section is for you. The authors still recommend seasoned professionals to read this part as well, not to learn but to perhaps see it from a perspective of a non-professional. </p>
<p>The experienced person within the field can, and should be able to jump into any of the modules and read.
The modules then continue into actual actions to do. And the reasons why. Each part of the module has been split up into several parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Beginner</em></p>
<p>This is the bare minimum that needs to be done. While not a full-fledged information security program, implementing all of the beginner steps gets you well on the way to evolve, understand and secure your information!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Intermediate</em> </p>
<p>This is for an organization that have already started working with information security albeit having few resources to do so. Perhaps grabbing one of the modules to add to their workflow. Or maybe taking the entire thing and modifying it to fit your needs. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Expert</em> </p>
<p>This is for an organization investing heavily into information security. Having tons of resources as their disposal, being able to run all the modules simulataneously and improving continiously. Perhaps even helping to contribute to this book!
<a href="" title="Working titles The best way to read this guide is to get a general understanding of 
information security and the short introduction.

If you have a good understanding what information security is all about, you
could jump directly to the moduls section.

&gt; Important to know is you will need the foundation of assessing your 
&gt; information, therfor the first moduls is mandatory for the other moduls to 
&gt; work. As long as you have the first module in place you are on a great start
&gt; and wich way your organisation takes after that is up you.

If there is one thing that you should take from this guide; that this is an
interative process, and that just by starting this process you have taken the 
first step to improve not only your security but your compliance as well.
It will be a difficult start and a steep learning curve, but the rewards are
that you will be safe and compliant with not only the laws like GDPR and 
EU directive like NIS, but also have a much better understanding and security
in case of a breach, you will be prepared and might even stop the intruder
before it can do any harm. ">//</a>: &lt;&gt; (Working titles)
Each of these</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most important thing though, is that information security is an iterative process. It is a never-ending job. It needs to evolve contantly, not only within your organisation, but also in tandem with the threat landscape.
There are new regulations and compliances every year examples include, but are not limited to GDPR(<em>General Data Protection Regulation</em>), NIS-directive(*Network and Information Security directive) and FISMA(<em>The Federal Information Security Management Act</em>). </p>
<p><em>The modules then go into more organizational work, something you as a professional, or someone new within the field can apply to your organization. The modules can be freely interchangeable, however, the authors recommend that they are done in order.</em></p>

<p>You take a picture of your child.
Instantly you look at the picture and determine if it is a good picture, is this something you want to save, or do you want to delete it? 
Assuming you want to save this picture. You have now created an asset, something that is of value to you.  Something that you want to protect, and keep.
You now have to determine the value of your asset. 
How would one determine the value of a picture. By looking at it of course, this you already did. But there are other variables at play. 
A picture is a moment frozen in time, something that will never happen again. The motive of the picture is your child, someone who will age - and at some point not look the same again. The occasion might be a happy or a sad one, something that you want to share with the world, or something you want to keep with only your closest friends and relatives. 
These are questions you automatically answer when looking at the picture, and the same thing applies to any asset you have. Any particular piece of information you have. </p>
<p>In addition to this, when determining the value of an asset, you look at it from several factors, can it provide you with gain of any kind, monetary, reputation wise or sentimental. The reason does not matter, as long as you know it yourself. </p>
<p>Based on the value of the picture, and the impact it has on you as an individual if it is seen by the wrong person, if the picture is corrupted and can no longer be viewed or if the picture is no longer available to you when you want to look at it you now have to make a few decisions. </p>
<p>We will look at this from an information security standpoint, what happens if either of confidentiality, integrity and availability is broken?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>, meaning if the picture is seen by someone who is not supposed or allowed to see it.</li>
<li><strong>Integrity</strong>, meaning if the picture is distorted, or changed in any way from the original.</li>
<li><strong>Availability</strong>, meaning if this picture is not available to you when you want to look at it, or when you want to see it, if it is lost forever?</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the impact to you personally?</p>
<p>What is the impact to your child?</p>
<p>Can this be harmful?</p>
<p><em>Can information in the picture be used to harm you, your family or another person or organisation?</em>
Is there an impact on your daily life?</p>
<p><em>Maybe want to use this picture to create holiday cards, or make a photo album.</em></p>
<p><em>Maybe you have this picture on your desk, to remind you of what is valuable in life?</em></p>
<p>Is there a financial impact?</p>
<p>Is there an impact on your reputation? </p>
<p><em>Can this picture be used to defame you and your family, or used as blackmail?</em></p>
<p>Your answer to these questions, any many more means you have now classified your picture, or the asset. It has a value, and has been categorized.</p>

<p>While we recommend that all modules are done in full, this one is mandatory. 
You need to know what you have in order to protect it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="introduction-1"><a class="header" href="#introduction-1">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>To begin your journey in information security, you need to know what you have in order to protect it. Once you have completed the steps in this module, you'll have a better understanding on what assets exist in your organization.
When talking about assets in this book, an asset is something that either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creates information or data.</li>
<li>Modifies information or data.</li>
<li>Reads information or data. </li>
</ol>
<p>An asset is basically anything that touches information or data in some way or another. From hereon, the terms information and data will be used in their respective manner. Data is a representation of facts, terms or instructions. Usually in a shape that is intended for transfer, interpretation or modification. Information is the meaning of the data, this means that once data has been interpreted by someone or something, it is transformed into information.</p>
<h3 id="example"><a class="header" href="#example">Example:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Random statistics from visitors to your website. The data itself means nothing. However, once the data has been processed, it creates a report, graphs and makes sense out of the data. This is what we call information. (<strong>CHANGE THIS EXAMPLE</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depending on the size of your organization, this is a daunting task and it might feel overwhelming to get started. Keep in mind that this is an iterative process, meaning we will repeat this entire module regularly. This also means that even if an asset is missed in the first cycle, you can always add it. Remember, getting started is better than doing nothing.</p>
<p>To begin with, we start by grouping up assets into categories, we have provided an example to use here, and this is what the authors base the other modules after as well. Feel free to modify and change anything to fit your organizational needs better. If you are a beginner, we recommend following our steps the first couple of cycles. </p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Person</th>
    <td>This category includes but are not limited to external consultants, management, board members. Any living being that touches information in some way at your organization. </td>

    <tr>
    <th>Information</th>
    <td>This is an advanced asset. Listing all the information an organization has is extremely time consuming. Later on in the module, we will explore ways to make this more easily managed. This is also what we are seeking to protect with information security. </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <th>Data</th>
    <td>This is another advanced asset. Listing all types of data in an organization is probably impossible. We'll cover this later on in the module as well.</td>
